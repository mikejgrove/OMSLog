OMSLog
======

The Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Surgery resident training log ontology (OMSLog) models the educational characteristics of surgical activities of trainees.  The ontology was initially created by merging a SNOMED-CT subset (7,000+classes) with domain curated concepts to improve granularity.  Future iterations may incorporate an anatomical ontology such as Uberon or Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA).
